spartez improved

This is an improved version of the test task and here you can find:
    - ECMAScript6 features
    - Readind data from JSON file
    - Page building on the client side
    - Auto data sorting for "Newest" and "Most popular" tabs 
    

Here I used Gulp to build it and gulp server plugin to see it.

All you need is write down in command line: <npm install> - you need node and npm installed;
                                                <gulp>
Or run some Apache with "result" dir as root dir.
                                                
It uses port :1209 (localhost:1209) if you run it with gulp.
